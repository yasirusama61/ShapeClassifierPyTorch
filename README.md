# ðŸŸ¢ Shape Classifier (PyTorch)

This project implements a basic vision classifier to distinguish between three geometric shapes â€” **circle**, **square**, and **triangle** â€” using synthetic images generated with Python's PIL library.

## ðŸ§ª Current Condition Implemented
- âœ… Fixed Length, Fixed Rotation

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture
A simple CNN with 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers is used. The model achieves 100% accuracy on this clean dataset.
